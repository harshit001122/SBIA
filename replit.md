# Smart Business Insights & Action Platform (SBIA)

## Overview

SBIA is a production-ready MERN stack web application designed for comprehensive business analytics and insights. The platform provides companies with integrated data analytics, team management, AI-powered recommendations, and multi-source data integration capabilities. Built with modern web technologies, it features a React frontend with shadcn/ui components, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, and session-based authentication.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session management
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL-based session storage with connect-pg-simple
- **Password Security**: Node.js crypto module with scrypt hashing

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe queries
- **Schema**: Shared TypeScript schema definitions with Zod validation
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- JWT-free session-based authentication using Passport.js
- Company-based user access control with role management
- Secure password hashing with salt using Node.js scrypt
- Protected routes with authentication middleware

### Database Schema
- **Users**: User profiles with company association and role-based access
- **Companies**: Multi-tenant company profiles with settings
- **Integrations**: Third-party service connections (analytics, CRM, e-commerce)
- **KPI Metrics**: Dynamic key performance indicators tracking
- **Chart Data**: Time-series data for visualization
- **AI Recommendations**: Machine learning-powered business insights
- **Activities**: System activity logging and audit trail
- **Notifications**: Real-time user notification system

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: KPI cards, revenue charts, user analytics, AI recommendations
- **Integrations**: Third-party service management with categorized providers
- **Team Management**: User invitation system with role-based permissions
- **Company Profile**: Organization settings and information management
- **Notifications**: Real-time notification center with read/unread tracking
- **Settings**: User profile and system configuration management

### API Structure
- RESTful API design with consistent error handling
- Real-time data synchronization with configurable refresh intervals
- Comprehensive CRUD operations for all entities
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Passport.js validates against database using scrypt password comparison
3. Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. Protected routes verify session authentication
5. User context provided throughout application

### Data Synchronization
1. Frontend components query API endpoints using TanStack Query
2. Server-side storage layer interfaces with Drizzle ORM
3. Database operations execute against PostgreSQL
4. Real-time updates via configurable polling intervals
5. Optimistic updates with error rollback

### Integration Management
1. Users configure third-party service connections
2. Credentials securely stored with encryption
3. Background synchronization processes update data
4. Activity logging tracks all integration events
5. Error handling and retry mechanisms
