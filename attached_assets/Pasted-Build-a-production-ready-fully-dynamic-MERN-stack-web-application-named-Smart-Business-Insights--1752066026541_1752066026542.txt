Build a production-ready, fully dynamic MERN stack web application named "Smart Business Insights & Action Platform (SBIA)". This project is intended for launch, so no hardcoded data should be used anywhere. All data should come from real API responses and the application should be thoroughly verified for complete functionality, smooth UX, and clean architecture.

Take your time to deeply verify and test every module. The final result should be a fully working system with dynamic features, proper validations, consistent error handling, optimized API integration, and responsive design.

ðŸ”§ CORE REQUIREMENTS
Remove ALL Hardcoded Values

Do not use any dummy or placeholder values in components, tables, charts, dropdowns, etc.

Every piece of data shown in the app must be fetched from backend APIs or stored backend data.

Even filter options, chart labels, table headers, etc., should be dynamic where relevant.

Ensure ALL Functionalities Work End-to-End

Test every feature and user interaction thoroughly.

Fix any non-working components, missing form handling, chart rendering issues, etc.

All CRUD operations must work dynamically via backend API integration.

State updates should reflect instantly across the UI where necessary.

Make Everything Fully API-Driven

Connect all UI elements to real, well-structured backend APIs.

Do not simulate or mock API responses.

Use async/await with error handling and loading indicators.

Use Clean, Maintainable Code

Split components modularly

Follow industry best practices

Use environment variables for all endpoints and secret keys

Optimize User Experience

Ensure the app is fully responsive and mobile-friendly

Use clean UI/UX with proper loading states, error states, and success messages

Use confirmation dialogs where needed (e.g., delete actions)

Functional Areas to Include (Fully Working)

Auth system (JWT, company-based access, role management)

API Integrations module (Google Analytics, CRM, Ads, etc.)

Dynamic dashboards with real-time chart data and insights

AI-based smart recommendation panel

Company profile and team management

Notification system (email + in-app)

Logs or sync history tracker

Settings & permissions

Deployment-Ready

Ensure the app runs smoothly with environment files (.env)

Provide a full README with setup steps

Separate development and production configs

Backend and frontend should be deployable independently (e.g., Vercel + Render/Hostinger)
